# Hero-Anvil
A C++ desktop app that will allow for users to create and print Pathfinder characters, allowing a lot of customization
The purpose of this project is to create a free, open source desktop application to assist building Pathfinder characters. 
Later on, perhaps D&D 5e can also be added, but there are probably licenses for that.
