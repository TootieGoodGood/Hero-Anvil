# Hero-Anvil
A C++ desktop app that will allow for users to create and print Pathfinder characters, allowing a lot of customization
The purpose of this project is to create a free, open source desktop application to assist building Pathfinder characters. 
Later on, perhaps D&D 5e can also be added, but there are probably licenses for that.
This project is based off of sCoreForge by The Blue Canary, but optimizing it and making it into it's own application.
